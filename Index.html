 *You’ve been called to the Office of Special Missions*
    <br>
*You enter and no one is there*
    <br>
*The President of the Special Missions enters *
    <br>
President: Welcome Agent, how are you? You were called today upon my request because we need to talk. The FBI has reached out to us and asked to cooperate to finally put an end to the case of the Death of the 12th president, Zachary Taylor. On July 9, 1850, the 12th President of the United States Zachary Taylor died. Here Let’s take a walk down the hallway. 
    <br>
*Y’all proceed to walk down a dark hallway*
    <br>
President:  Taylor's death sparked conspiracy theories about the exhumation of the tomb. Taylor's tenure in the US was very short. Only 16 months, in which his power ceased when he died. Taylor died after four days of suffering from various symptoms. He had severe cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and dehydration. Private doctors concluded Taylor died of cholera morbus, a bacterial infection of the small intestine. According to the doctor, the cause of cholera morbus in Taylor was due to the food he consumed. When celebrating July 4 or US Independence Day, Taylor had time to eat cherries and ice milk in large quantities. But other sources claim Taylor died of gastroenteritis caused by very sour cherries combined with milk. Others also suspect Taylor of food poisoning or typhoid fever.
    <br>
*You began to zone out as y’all reach the end of the hall and see a big machine*
    <br>
President: Conspiracy theories for Taylor's murder are inevitable because Taylor is a union member. Some people suspect Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery conspirators. At that time Taylor was also in good health. The cause of death that linked cherries and ice milk was deemed absurd. The assassination estimate made more sense when Millard Fillmore succeeded Taylor as president. At that time the anti-slavery wave in Congress turned into a compromise. Most historians are satisfied with the explanation that Zachary Taylor died of illness after consuming large quantities of cherries and ice milk. Now its up to us to find out what happened. You might be wondering how and why we are here.
    <br>
*You began to nod your head up and down*
    <br>
President: Well, this is the new Time Machine, and Agent will be the first to use it, it is up to you to go back in time and find out the truth. You got an hour to get everything you need, and report back hear.
    <br>
*One hour Later*
    <br>
*Its time you step into the Time Machine, and next thing you know you’re in the Office of the President* </p>
